This prototype is a question designing tool and I assumed some main functionalities like below:

-Ability of giving a topic to the question in Question short description
-Ability of giving a longer description for question
-Ability of adding dynamic answers for different type of questions
-Ability of giving a hint expression 
-Ability of showing a preview of what created in question and answers
-Ability of sorting answers based on an order that entered
-Ability of sorting by random
-Ability of defaulting point which should be a required field

Based on the above requirement I tried my best in limited time to create that page in a single project and used the following CSS and JavaScript libraries:
-Jquery
-AngularJs
-Bootstrap

Other things which used in this page just pure html and some simple css classes. The page is designed to be responsive as much as possible. Because of limited time I skipped drag-n-drop moving answer order and binding answers preview.
I used an EC2 Amazon machine to deploy my project which is reachable in this address http://52.34.47.87:8080/hksam/home.
